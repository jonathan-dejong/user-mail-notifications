Sends an email to all users in a specific role when a new post has been made

== Description ==

Creates a new meta box in the post edit screen where you may choose from the provided roles in WordPress and automatically send them an email when the post is saved/updated. This means that you can for instance selectively notify members when a new post has been made or perhaps let your authors push a notification to you as admin that they’ve published a new draft. It can be utilized as an extremely simple and lightweight newsletter function. 

= Available settings =
* You can set which user roles should be available to send emails to from the post edit screen
* You can use the email templating to customize the sent out emails. Features a WYSIWYG editor which allows you to freely style the email. More customization will be added later on. 

= Languages =
* English
* Swedish
